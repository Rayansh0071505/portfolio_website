AI INVESTMENT AND MONITORING PLATFORM - PROJECT SUMMARY
===============================================

PROJECT PERIOD: November 2025 - January 2026
ROLE: Founding AI Engineer


WHAT IS AI INVESTMENT AND MONITORING PLATFORM?
-----------------
AI Investment and Monitoring Platform is an AI-powered investor intelligence platform for venture capital firms,
private equity firms, and institutional investors. It provides highly intelligent
automated reports to analyze and monitor portfolio companies end-to-end using AI.


THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
----------------------
Investors (VCs, private equity, angel investors) need to:
- Analyze companies comprehensively without spending 10+ hours per deal
- Monitor portfolio companies continuously with real-time intelligence
- Get intelligent reports that analyze all important factors: market size, competitive
  landscape, financials, team quality, growth potential, unit economics
- Determine company performance and predict future success
- Make data-driven investment decisions


THE SOLUTION
------------
An AI analyst that:
- Remembers every company forever (persistent portfolio memory)
- Performs precise financial analysis (no calculation errors)
- Synthesizes private portfolio data with real-time market intelligence
- Applies the investor's personal investment thesis to every deal
- Enables cross-company queries ("Show all SaaS companies with ARR > $1M")
- Automates due diligence (pitch deck analysis, competitor research, market analysis)
- Available 24/7 with 99.9% uptime


WHAT I DEVELOPED
-----------------

1. Multi-Agent RAG System
   - 4 specialized AI agents:
     * Investor Assistant - Company research with web search, pitch deck analysis
     * Finance Assistant - Excel/CSV analysis with precise calculations
     * Book Training AI - Learn from investment books and apply principles
     * Trained AI - Personalized analyst based on investor thesis
   - Tools: LangGraph, LangChain, Google Vertex AI (Gemini), Groq (LLaMA)

2. RAG Pipeline
   - Semantic search across pitch decks, websites, financial models
   - Pinecone vector database with 2 indexes (documents + books)
   - HuggingFace embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
   - Sub-second retrieval, zero hallucinations

3. AWS Infrastructure
   - Deployed on ECS Fargate (serverless containers)
   - 99.9% uptime using multi-model fallback (Gemini → Groq)
   - CloudFront CDN, Application Load Balancer, VPC with NAT Gateways
   - Auto-scaling 1-10 tasks
   - CI/CD via GitHub Actions

4. Private LLM Hosting
   - Hosted open-source models (Qwen 3, Kimi K2 thinking) on private servers
   - Used vLLM + Ray for sensitive investor data processing
   - Data sovereignty compliance

5. Real-Time Intelligence
   - Web search integration (Tavily API)
   - Web scraping (Playwright)
   - Competitor analysis
   - Market research automation

6. Financial Analysis System
   - Python calculator tool for precise math (no LLM errors)
   - Multi-sheet Excel processing
   - Automated financial model analysis
   - Risk assessment

7. Full-Stack Platform
   - React 18 + TypeScript frontend
   - FastAPI backend (Python 3.12)
   - MongoDB Atlas for company data storage
   - Google Cloud Storage for documents
   - JWT authentication
