WHAT IS EVEREST COMMERCE GROUP?
--------------------------------
Everest Commerce Group is a holding company that acquires and operates multiple e-commerce
businesses. They needed AI-powered solutions to monitor, analyze, and optimize performance
across all their acquired companies in real-time.


MY ROLE AS AI SOLUTION ENGINEER
--------------------------------
As an AI Solution Engineer, my job was to:
1. Understand business problems across different departments (marketing, analytics, supply chain, M&A)
2. Design and build end-to-end AI automation solutions
3. Create orchestrations of multiple AI agents that work autonomously in the background
4. Build systems that continuously monitor platforms (Facebook, Shopify, e-commerce stores)
5. Deliver automated reports and insights to the team every morning
6. Integrate all company data and create unified intelligence systems


WHAT I BUILT
------------

MY APPROACH: MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION
---------------------------------------

How I Build AI Solutions:
1. Understand the business problem deeply
2. Break it down into smaller tasks
3. Design specialized agents for each task
4. Create orchestration layer that coordinates agents
5. Implement background jobs that run continuously
6. Set up monitoring and reporting
7. Deploy end-to-end solution

Example: Marketing Intelligence System
- Agent 1: Scrapes Facebook Ads Library (runs daily at 6 AM)
- Agent 2: Scrapes competitor Shopify stores (runs every 12 hours)
- Agent 3: Analyzes Google Analytics data (runs hourly)
- Agent 4: Monitors email campaign performance (real-time)
- Agent 5: Synthesizes all data and generates report (runs daily at 8 AM)
- Report delivered to marketing team's inbox every morning

All agents work autonomously in the background. No human intervention needed.
