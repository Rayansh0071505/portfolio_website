   How It Works:
   - Define campaign parameters:
     * Target audience demographics
     * Content niche/category
     * Engagement rate requirements
     * Follower count range
     * Geographic location
     * Budget constraints
   - Algorithm scrapes Instagram/TikTok
   - Analyzes profiles matching criteria
   - Scores each influencer (0-100)
   - Returns ranked list with:

   - "What's my audience sentiment on posts?"
   - "Recommend optimal posting times"
   - "Should I collaborate with influencer X?"

   How RAG Works:
   - Question from user
   - Search influencer's historical data in vector DB
   - Retrieve relevant metrics, posts, comments
   - Pass to LLM with context
